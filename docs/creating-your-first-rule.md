# Creating Your First Detection Rule

Welcome! This guide will walk you through creating your first Microsoft Sentinel detection rule using our beginner-friendly, data-driven approach.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to create a detection rule from scratch
- Understanding the new data-driven architecture
- How to write effective KQL queries
- How to test and deploy your rule safely

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of KQL (Kusto Query Language)
- Access to the repository
- Azure Sentinel workspace set up
- Azure CLI installed and logged in

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Plan Your Detection

Before you start coding, think about:
- **What are you trying to detect?** (e.g., suspicious logins, malware activity)
- **What data source will you use?** (e.g., SigninLogs, SecurityEvent, AuditLogs)
- **What's the threshold?** (e.g., 5 failed logins in 5 minutes)
- **What ATT&CK technique does this map to?** (e.g., T1078 for credential access)

### Step 2: Create Your KQL Query

Create a new file in the `kql/` directory:

```bash
# Create your KQL file
touch kql/my-first-detection.kql
```

Write your detection query. Here's a simple example for detecting multiple failed logins:

```kql
// kql/my-first-detection.kql
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where ResultType != 0  // Failed logins only
| summarize FailedCount = count(), 
          Applications = make_set(AppDisplayName), 
          Locations = make_set(Location), 
          TimeSpan = max(TimeGenerated) - min(TimeGenerated) 
    by IPAddress, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| where FailedCount >= 5  // Alert if 5+ failed attempts
| where TimeSpan < 30m    // Within 30 minutes
| take 100
```

**Tips for writing good KQL:**
- Start simple and add complexity gradually
- Test your query in Sentinel Logs first
- Use `summarize` to group and count events
- Add time filters to avoid querying too much data
- Use `take` to limit results

### Step 3: Test Your KQL Query

1. **Go to your Sentinel workspace**
2. **Open Logs**
3. **Paste your KQL query**
4. **Click "Run"** to see if it works
5. **Check the results** - do they look right?

### Step 4: Add Your Rule to Dev Environment

Open `env/deploy-dev.bicep` and add your rule to the `rules` array:

```bicep
// Load your KQL file
var kqlMyDetection = loadTextContent('../kql/my-first-detection.kql')

var rules = [
  // ... existing rules ...
  {
    name: 'uc-my-first-detection'                    // Unique identifier
    displayName: '[DEV] [ORG] – My First Detection'  // Name in Sentinel
    kql: kqlMyDetection                              // Your KQL query
    severity: 'Medium'                               // How serious is this?
    enabled: true                                    // Turn it on
    frequency: 'PT1H'                                // Run every hour
    period: 'PT1H'                                   // Look back 1 hour
    tactics: [ 'InitialAccess' ]                     // ATT&CK tactics
    techniques: [ 'T1078' ]                          // ATT&CK techniques
    createIncident: false                            // No incidents in dev
    grouping: {}                                     // Use default grouping
    entities: {                                      // Extract entities
      ipAddress: 'IPAddress'
    }
    customDetails: {}                                // No custom details
  }
]
```

### Step 5: Add Your Rule to Prod Environment

Copy the same rule to `env/deploy-prod.bicep` but adjust for production:

```bicep
{
  name: 'uc-my-first-detection'
  displayName: '[PROD] [ORG] – My First Detection'  // Changed to PROD
  kql: kqlMyDetection
  severity: 'High'                                   // Higher severity for prod
  enabled: true
  frequency: 'PT1H'
  period: 'PT1H'
  tactics: [ 'InitialAccess' ]
  techniques: [ 'T1078' ]
  createIncident: true                               // Create incidents in prod
  grouping: {}
  entities: {
    ipAddress: 'IPAddress'
  }
  customDetails: {}
}
```

### Step 6: Test Locally

Before you deploy, test that everything works:

```bash
# Test that your Bicep files are valid
az bicep build --file env/deploy-dev.bicep

# See what would be deployed (without actually deploying)
az deployment group what-if \
  --resource-group your-dev-resource-group \
  --template-file env/deploy-dev.bicep \
  --parameters env/params/dev.jsonc
```

### Step 7: Deploy Your Rule

1. **Create a Pull Request** with your changes
2. **The pipeline will automatically**:
   - Validate your Bicep files
   - Deploy to Dev environment
   - Run tests
3. **Wait for approval** before it goes to Prod

## 🎯 Understanding Each Part

### Rule Configuration

| Property | What it does | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `name` | Unique identifier | `'uc-my-detection'` |
| `displayName` | Name in Sentinel portal | `'[DEV] [ORG] – My Detection'` |
| `kql` | Your detection query | `kqlMyDetection` |
| `severity` | How serious is this? | `'Medium'`, `'High'`, `'Critical'` |
| `enabled` | Turn rule on/off | `true` or `false` |
| `frequency` | How often to run | `'PT1H'` (every hour) |
| `period` | How far back to look | `'PT1H'` (last hour) |

### ATT&CK Mapping

```bicep
tactics: [ 'InitialAccess', 'Execution' ]    // High-level tactics
techniques: [ 'T1078', 'T1059' ]             // Specific techniques
```

**Common ATT&CK Tactics:**
- `InitialAccess` - Getting into the network
- `Execution` - Running code
- `Persistence` - Staying in the network
- `PrivilegeEscalation` - Getting higher permissions
- `DefenseEvasion` - Avoiding detection

### Entity Mapping

Tell Sentinel what entities to extract from your alerts:

```bicep
entities: {
  accountFullName: 'SubjectUserName'  // Extract Account entity
  hostName: 'Computer'                // Extract Host entity
  ipAddress: 'IPAddress'              // Extract IP entity
}
```

### Custom Details

Add custom fields to your alerts:

```bicep
customDetails: {
  FailedAttempts: 'FailedCount'       // Add custom field
  Applications: 'Applications'        // Add another field
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Rule

### 1. Test the KQL Query
- Run it in Sentinel Logs
- Check the results make sense
- Verify it doesn't return too much data

### 2. Test the Bicep Template
```bash
az bicep build --file env/deploy-dev.bicep
```

### 3. Test the Deployment
```bash
az deployment group what-if \
  --resource-group your-dev-rg \
  --template-file env/deploy-dev.bicep \
  --parameters env/params/dev.jsonc
```

### 4. Monitor Your Rule
- Check that it's enabled in Sentinel
- Look for alerts being generated
- Verify the severity and details are correct

## 🆘 Common Issues and Solutions

### "Property doesn't exist" Error
**Problem**: Missing properties in your rule object
**Solution**: Make sure all rule objects have `grouping: {}` and `customDetails: {}`

### KQL Column Errors
**Problem**: Referencing columns that don't exist in your query
**Solution**: Check that your KQL actually returns the columns you're referencing

### No Alerts Generated
**Problem**: Rule is running but not finding anything
**Solution**: 
- Check your KQL query returns results in Sentinel Logs
- Verify your data sources are enabled
- Check the time range and frequency settings

### Too Many Alerts
**Problem**: Rule is generating too many alerts
**Solution**:
- Increase your threshold (e.g., from 5 to 10 failed attempts)
- Add more specific filters to your KQL
- Adjust the time window

## 📚 Next Steps

Once you've created your first rule:

1. **Learn more KQL**: Practice writing different types of queries
2. **Explore ATT&CK**: Map your detections to specific techniques
3. **Add entity mapping**: Extract useful entities from your alerts
4. **Create custom details**: Add relevant fields to your alerts
5. **Optimize performance**: Make your queries more efficient
